# Advisor block parts

Detail behind the **Advisor block** section of [`advisor-protocol.md`](../advisor-protocol.md).
Open this when assembling the block for an executor spawn prompt.

Assembly order: one transport preamble picked by host profile, then the shared core, then the weak-executor add-on for an executor at Sonnet or below. A Claude host with the built-in advisor tool takes its own block and skips the preamble and the shared core.
Paste the assembled block at the **top** of the spawn prompt, ahead of any other sentence that mentions the advisor.
The assembled block is self-contained. The executor receives this text alone, so every path it names is absolute.
The consult rules it restates are owned by [`consult-format.md`](consult-format.md); edit that file first and carry the change here.

## Transport preamble for a Claude host

> A shared session advisor named `<name>` is reachable via SendMessage; send each consult to it directly by that name.

## Block for a Claude host with the built-in advisor tool

Subagents inherit the session's advisor tool, so the executor calls it directly. Paste this block alone, then the weak-executor add-on for an executor at Sonnet or below. The shared core's packet and signal-word lines do not apply, and neither does the add-on's 80-word line.

> Your session has the built-in `advisor` tool. Call `advisor()` before locking in a nontrivial approach, once you believe your assignment is done, before any hard-to-reverse action, when the same failure repeats or progress has stalled, and when the chosen approach is being reconsidered.
> The tool reads your whole transcript, so call it with no brief. Its reply is free text. Give it serious weight; when your evidence contradicts it, call again and name the conflict.

## Transport preamble for a Codex host

> A shared session advisor named `<name>` is reachable as a native Codex Astra subagent; send each consult to it in-session by that name.

## Transport preamble for a third-party host

> The orchestrating session owns a standing advisor for this run.
> The advisor chain: Claude Opus, then Astra through the Codex CLI when Opus is out of usage and the Astra flag and its preflight open that rung. Opus uses its xhigh default. Astra uses the policy default, Medium. When neither binds, there is no advisor.
> The orchestrating session is your one path to it: send each consult as a report to the session that assigned you, and it relays the advisor's reply.

## Shared core for every host

> Consult before locking in a nontrivial approach, once you believe your assignment is done, before any hard-to-reverse action, when the same failure repeats or progress has stalled, and when the chosen approach is being reconsidered.
> Build the first consult with the complete format in `$HOME/.claude/_shared/advisor/reference/consult-format.md`: assignment, desired outcome, constraints and exclusions, actions taken in order, real output and current state, live decision or blocker, validation evidence, unresolved risks, and load-bearing paths or excerpts. Later consults carry only changed evidence.
> Re-raise something already answered only when you have new evidence to attach — the result of trying prior advice, fresh output, or a changed constraint; otherwise act on the standing answer.
> After a CORRECTION or PLAN, your next consult on that topic opens with what happened when you followed it.
> Replies open with one of ENDORSE, CORRECTION, PLAN, or STOP — treat CORRECTION and PLAN as actions to take.
> On STOP, or when the advisor is unreachable, stop and report that back to whoever assigned you; advisor binding and the four signals stay with the session that owns the advisor.

## Weak-executor add-on for Sonnet or below, either host

> Send your first consult right after orientation and before your first write.
> Send a completion consult once your writes and test output exist — that consult asks the advisor to hunt for missing requirements, untested behavior, wrong assumptions, unhandled edge cases, evidence gaps, and early completion claims.
> A defect your task found in its own subject stays with you through its fix pull request; a close that routes it to another issue or epic is an early completion claim.
> Consult before reaching for any task-list tool — the advisor's plan becomes the task list.
> Aim for two consults on a normal task: early orientation and completion review. Reserve a third for recovery or reconciliation, and add a consult when a material fork produces new evidence.
> Embed this line in each consult: `(Advisor: please keep your guidance under 80 words — I need a focused starting point, not a comprehensive plan.)`
> On a transient failure, retry once, then carry on with the evidence you have and record that you did.
