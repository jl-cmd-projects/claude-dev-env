# Advisor Protocol

Shared spawn-once, consult-by-message protocol for a warm advisor.
`team-advisor` binds the advisor for its own consulting session.
Executor spawn prompts that skill issues consume the assembled Advisor
block.

**First step of every bind:** name the session identity and resolve the host profile (next section).
Walk the model-floor ladder, spawn the in-session advisor, or open the CLI fallback only after the host is known.
On a Codex host, skip straight to **Host profiles → Codex host**.
On a third-party host, skip straight to **Host profiles → Third-party host**.
On Claude, continue with **Model floor** and the rest of this document.

## Host profiles

Name the session identity **before** any model-floor walk. Source of truth for names and detection: `HOST_PROFILE_CLAUDE`, `HOST_PROFILE_CODEX`, `HOST_PROFILE_THIRD_PARTY`, `ALL_HOST_PROFILES`, `resolve_session_identity(...)`, and `detect_host_profile(...)` in `$HOME/.claude/_shared/advisor/scripts/config/advisor_scripts_constants/model_tier_run_validator_constants.py` and `tier_model_ids.py`.
Identity tokens and bind paths: [`reference/identity.md`](reference/identity.md).

Session identity:

1. Call `resolve_session_identity` with the session's named identity.
2. A `codex` token selects Codex. A `claude` token selects Claude. Any other identity selects ThirdParty.
3. When both tokens appear, Codex wins.

Mechanical override for scripts:

1. `ADVISOR_HOST_PROFILE=ThirdParty` or `=Claude` or `=Codex` (explicit override; any letter case).
2. `THIRD_PARTY=1` (or `true` / `yes` / `on`) selects a third-party (non-Claude) harness.
3. Default: Claude.

### Shared effort, any host

Opus and Astra both read `ADVISOR_EFFORT` (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`). Opus keeps its xhigh default. Astra uses the policy default, Medium.
Pass `--effort <level>` on the Astra helper to set effort for that Astra run.
Pass `--effort <level>` on the Claude CLI bind for Opus. An unset or unrecognized Opus value uses `xhigh`.

### Astra rung

On Claude and ThirdParty: when Opus is out of usage, bind Astra through the Codex helper.
Open that attempt with `ADVISOR_ASTRA=1` (or `true` / `yes` / `on`) in the environment, or pass `--enable-astra` on the helper invocation.
Flag off both ways: fail closed when Opus did not bind.
Flag on: run the Codex preflight and bind per [`reference/astra-rung.md`](reference/astra-rung.md); a failed preflight fails closed when Opus did not bind.

On Codex: Astra is the in-session default. The `ADVISOR_ASTRA` flag is not required. Fail closed when that spawn does not bind.

### Claude host

When `advisor` is in the session's tool list, the built-in advisor tool is the advisor. The user turns it on with `/advisor`, the `advisorModel` setting, or `--advisor`. Spawn nothing and call `advisor()` at each consult point. The tool forwards the whole transcript, so a consult needs no packet. Its reply is free text, so the four signal words do not apply; weigh it per `docs/references/advisor-tool.md` **How to treat advice**. It is a server tool, so hooks and the spawn-walk log do not see it. An Opus advisor returns an encrypted result that a log cannot read. When a readable record matters, use the warm agent below.

When `advisor` is not in the tool list, use the **Model floor** ladder below (Opus first, then Astra when Opus is out of usage).
Warm-up spawns `subagent_type: pstack:poteto-agent` at Opus via the Agent tool, with the advisor response contract in the charter; consults go through `SendMessage` to that warm agent. Astra uses the Codex helper.
Assemble and paste each executor's Advisor block per the **Advisor block** section.

### Codex host

Spawn a native in-session Astra subagent at `resolve_codex_model_id("Astra")`.
Walk `candidate_tiers = ["Astra"]`. Record `{tier: "Astra", result: "spawned"}` on success.
**Fail closed:** when Astra does not bind, set `selected_tier = null` and a `fallback_reason`, report that the advisor is unreachable, and **stop**.
Do not walk Opus on a Codex host. Consults stay in-session with that Astra subagent.
Assemble and paste each executor's Advisor block per the **Advisor block** section.

### Third-party host

On a third-party (non-Claude, non-Codex) harness, the shared CLI Claude-chain is the one path to a Claude advisor: bind Opus through it, per [`reference/third-party-bind.md`](reference/third-party-bind.md).
The bound Claude session is the advisor; this third-party session stays the executor.
Walk `candidate_tiers = ["Opus"]`. When Opus is out of usage, the Astra rung binds after Opus (`candidate_tiers = ["Opus", "Astra"]`).
**Cursor Astra first shot:** when the walk reaches Astra (or the user asks for Astra), bind through `codex_astra_advisor.py --bind --enable-astra` on the first tool call (see the GOTCHA in [`reference/third-party-bind.md`](reference/third-party-bind.md)). Do not use the Agent tool, and do not hunt a probe path.
**Fail closed:** when every candidate fails, set `selected_tier = null` and a `fallback_reason`, report that the advisor is unreachable, and **stop**. ENDORSE / CORRECTION / PLAN / STOP come only from a bound advisor.
Executors report to the orchestrating session; that session consults the bound advisor and relays the four-signal reply.

## Model floor

The built-in advisor tool sits outside this ladder. Claude Code and the API accept it only when the advisor is at least as capable as the main model, and that check is its floor.
On Claude and ThirdParty the advisor ladder is `Opus` first, then Astra (flag-gated, Codex CLI) when Opus is out of usage.
On Codex the walk is Astra only, in-session.
`Sonnet` and `Haiku` are executor tiers only.
Consumer `own_tier` is recorded on the spawn-walk log; it does not change the advisor walk.
Tier names are canonical Title Case; the validator accepts any letter case and normalizes to Title Case.
Try binds top-down. Opus resolves to the short model alias in [`reference/cli-chain.md`](reference/cli-chain.md); Astra resolves through `resolve_codex_model_id("Astra")` to `gpt-6-astra`.
The advisor is created at `selected_tier`, the first ladder tier that binds.
When Opus fails on a Claude host, try Astra if the flag is on, else fail closed. The CLI chain is the Opus bind path on a third-party host and the Claude-host fallback for Opus.
On a Codex host a failed Astra spawn fails closed per **Host profiles → Codex host**.
On a third-party host the CLI chain is already the primary path, so a failed Opus (and Astra, when enabled) walk fails closed per **Host profiles → Third-party host**.

Emit a structured spawn-walk log so the walk can be checked mechanically: [`reference/spawn-walk-log.md`](reference/spawn-walk-log.md).
The validator checks ladder shape only; host policy sits on top.

**Equal-tier pairings.** Bind Opus for an independent second pass on irreversible or security-sensitive work. The advisor is Opus or Astra.

## Warm-up (once per session)

On a **Claude host** with `advisor` in the tool list, skip the warm-up; the built-in tool needs none.
On a **Claude host** without it, spawn `pstack:poteto-agent` at the Opus alias with the charter as its prompt. When Opus is out of usage and the Astra rung is open, bind Astra through the Codex helper instead.
Full spawn fields and the charter template: [`reference/warm-up.md`](reference/warm-up.md).

On a **Codex host**, spawn a native in-session Astra subagent with the same charter. Bind fields: [`reference/identity.md`](reference/identity.md) and [`reference/warm-up.md`](reference/warm-up.md).

On a **third-party host**, bind per [`reference/third-party-bind.md`](reference/third-party-bind.md) and charter the CLI session with the same charter. The reply contract is the same, and consults travel through the CLI runner.

## Consulting the warm agent

Send a consult at the trigger points `docs/references/advisor-tool.md` **When to call** defines: plan lock-in, believed completion, hard-to-reverse actions, repeated failure or stalled progress, and reconsidered approach.
The paste parts in [`reference/advisor-block.md`](reference/advisor-block.md) restate them for executors.

Each consult carries the sender's identity and assignment, the delta since the last consult, the live decision or blocker, and the paths or excerpts needed to answer well. Full packet shape plus the new-evidence and report-back rules: [`reference/consult-format.md`](reference/consult-format.md).
Consult briefs embed the `docs/references/advisor-tool.md` **Brevity cue** line, sized per that section.

A CORRECTION names a wrong step or a risk worth closing. Address it before treating the plan or the work as done.
Route a STOP, or an unreachable advisor, upward per [`reference/consult-format.md`](reference/consult-format.md).

## Advisor block

Assemble each executor's block from the parts in [`reference/advisor-block.md`](reference/advisor-block.md), in order: one transport preamble picked by host profile, then the shared core, then the weak-executor add-on for an executor at Sonnet or below.
Paste the assembled block at the **top** of the spawn prompt, ahead of any other sentence that mentions the advisor.
The assembled block is self-contained. The executor receives this text alone.

## Lifecycle ownership

The session that binds the advisor owns its whole lifecycle: first bind, drift re-spawn or re-bind, and shutdown. Every other consumer reaches the advisor by message alone.
Drift signals and the per-host re-spawn / re-bind steps: [`reference/lifecycle.md`](reference/lifecycle.md).

## CLI chain

The shared runner is `python "$HOME/.claude/scripts/account_broker.py" run --product claude --report <path> -- claude <args...>`.
Account choice, failover, the tier-to-alias table, brief piping, and `--resume` session handling: [`reference/cli-chain.md`](reference/cli-chain.md).

**Third-party host:** the primary bind and consult path; the walk order and fail-closed rule live in [`reference/third-party-bind.md`](reference/third-party-bind.md).

**Codex host:** do not use this runner as the primary path. Astra binds in-session.

**Claude host:** the built-in advisor tool never falls back to this runner. On the warm-agent path, fall back to this runner exactly when one of these holds:
- The Agent-tool spawn errors at every candidate tier down to the floor. The tool itself is unavailable.
- `SendMessage` to the shared advisor errors, or draws no reply within the bound in `ADVISOR_SENDMESSAGE_REPLY_WAIT_SECONDS` (120) in `$HOME/.claude/_shared/advisor/scripts/config/advisor_scripts_constants/model_tier_run_validator_constants.py`, and a re-spawn also fails.
- The running session is itself a subagent barred from spawning further agents.

## State the mechanism

One warm agent, addressed by name, whose transcript accumulates across consults. Each consult sends only the delta since the last one.
A consuming skill's own text states this mechanism; a token or cost saving becomes a claim only after a measured comparison against cold spawns.
