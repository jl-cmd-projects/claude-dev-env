"""PostToolUse dispatcher that hosts the Bash hook chain running after a call.

Named ``bash_post_call_dispatcher`` rather than the more obvious
``bash_post_tool_use_dispatcher``: ``bin/install.test.mjs`` counts every
PostToolUse command whose text contains the literal substring
``post_tool_use_dispatcher.py`` and asserts exactly one match, against the
unrelated Write/Edit dispatcher in ``validation/post_tool_use_dispatcher.py``.
That check carries no basename anchor (its PreToolUse sibling does), so a
correctly-named Bash-side sibling here would read as a second match of an
unrelated dispatcher. This name carries the same meaning without the
collision, and needs no change to that shared, out-of-scope test file.

Reads the tool payload from stdin once, selects the hosted hooks applicable to
the payload's tool name, and runs each one in-process via the shared
hosted-hook runner. A hosted PostToolUse hook here carries no permission
decision -- it is an observer, not a gate -- so this dispatcher runs the whole
roster unconditionally and never blocks. The one thing it forwards is context:
a hosted hook may print a ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` string (the
PR done reminder does), and the dispatcher joins every such string into one
PostToolUse payload through the shared emitter every PostToolUse hook here
writes with. A hook that prints nothing adds nothing.

A single hosted hook crash fails open: ``run_hook_capturing_output`` isolates
it, so it contributes nothing and does not stop the remaining hosted hooks.

One interpreter start here serves the whole roster: every hosted hook's
imports load once into this process rather than once per hook.
