"""PostToolUse hook: record files edited this session for the stage gate.

Picture finishing a change, running `git commit`, and later finding one file
never made it in — it was edited but never staged, and the commit dropped it
silently. This hook prevents that by remembering every file the session
touches. After each Write, Edit, or MultiEdit it appends the edited file's
resolved absolute path to a per-session JSON file in the system temp directory,
which the stage gate reads at commit time. Concurrent invocations — the case
parallel Write or Edit calls in one turn produce — serialize on a best-effort
per-session lock file. When the lock cannot be acquired within the timeout, the
write proceeds without it rather than stalling the edit that triggered the hook.

The hook never blocks a tool call. A non-edit tool, a malformed payload, a
missing file path, or a failed write each returns quietly, so a logging problem
never interrupts the edit that triggered it.
