"""SessionStart and SessionEnd hook: clear this session's own tracker file.

The session-edit tracker writes a per-session JSON file under the system temp
directory, and the stage gate reads only the running session's own file at
commit time. This hook deletes that file only when the session is genuinely
beginning or ending: at a fresh SessionStart (a ``startup`` source) so a new
session begins with an empty record, and at session end so a clean exit leaves
nothing behind. A SessionStart that continues the same conversation — a compact
or a resume — keeps the in-flight tracker, so an edit already recorded this
session survives the continuation.

A tracker file belongs to one session and is read only by that same session, so
a file a hard-crashed session leaves behind is inert — no other session ever
reads it. Cleanup keys off the session lifecycle rather than a file's age, so a
live session that pauses for a long review gap keeps its own tracker: no peer
session deletes another session's file.

The hook exits zero on every branch and never blocks the session.
