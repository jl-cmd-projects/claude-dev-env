"""Constants for the piped-pytest PreToolUse Bash blocker.

Holds the tool names, the pytest program basenames and the python-interpreter
basename pattern, the module-run flag and module name, the pipe and
segment-reset operator token sets, the line-continuation and physical-line
patterns, the heredoc-opener pattern that marks a script body, the
comment-start pattern that ends a line early, the parenthesis-group counters
that join a multi-line subshell, the group-closing reserved words a pipe reads
a group's status through, the body-introducing reserved words that stand ahead
of the command whose status a compound reports, the single characters the hot
path tests before it parses, the option-token pattern that separates a wrapper's
flags from its first operand, the wrapper commands whose run passes through to
the program behind them, the separator that rejoins a wrapper's argument
tokens, the empty commenter set that leaves ``#`` to the comment-start pattern,
the quote characters stripped before a basename read, and the deny message.
Segment helpers come from ``shell_command_segments.py``. Quote-aware pipeline
parsing lives in ``shell_command_pipeline``. Pytest invocation classification
that consumes these program, wrapper, and option constants lives in
``pytest_invocation``.

Two wrapper shapes reach the program behind them differently. ``sudo`` and
``uvx`` take their own option flags and then the command, so the step-over drops
the flags. ``uv``, ``poetry``, ``pipenv``, ``pdm``, ``hatch``, ``rye``, and
``coverage`` take the literal ``run`` subcommand first, so the step-over reads
that word and passes only when it is there — ``uv sync`` and ``coverage report``
keep the wrapper as its own program. ``uv`` spells the same pass-through as
``uv tool run`` too, so ``TOOL_SUBCOMMAND_NAME`` names the word the step-over
reads before it looks for ``run``. A ``run`` subcommand takes its own flags too,
so the step-over drops those before it reads the program.

An option that takes a separate value swallows the token after it, so
``sudo -u someone pytest`` runs pytest while ``uv run --with pytest mypy .``
runs mypy. ``ALL_VALUE_TAKING_WRAPPER_OPTION_FLAGS`` names those flags so the
operand scan reads past the value rather than mistaking it for the program, and
``ALL_VALUE_TAKING_SHELL_OPTION_FLAGS`` does the same for the shells that run a
command string, so the ``-c`` behind ``bash -o pipefail`` stays visible. POSIX
lets short options cluster, and a cluster's value is the next token only when
the value-taking letter ends the cluster — ``sudo -nu ci`` takes ``ci`` while
``sudo -nuci`` carries the value glued on. ``SHORT_OPTION_CLUSTER_PATTERN``
marks the tokens that walk letter by letter for that reading.
``--`` ends an option list outright: every token after it is an operand however
it is spelled, so ``bash -- -c script`` runs a script named ``-c`` rather than a
command string.

A POSIX shell reads ``-c`` inside a cluster as well, so ``bash -euc 'pytest'``
runs the command string the same way ``bash -c 'pytest'`` does.
``ALL_CLUSTERED_STRING_EXEC_OPTION_LETTERS`` names the letters that carry that
reading, and ``ALL_SHORT_OPTION_CLUSTERING_SHELL_BASENAMES`` limits it to the
shells that cluster: PowerShell spells its options as words, where the ``c`` in
``-NonInteractive`` is a letter of a name rather than an option of its own. The
letter check reads the token in its own case, because ``-C`` is bash's noclobber
switch while ``-c`` takes the command string.

A shell ends a pipeable compound command with a reserved word as well as with
``)`` or ``}``: ``fi``, ``done``, and ``esac``. ``ALL_GROUP_CLOSE_TOKENS`` names
all five, so a pipe after one steps back to the command whose exit status the
compound reports. The body of such a compound opens with a reserved word of its
own — ``then``, ``do``, or ``else`` — which stands ahead of the command rather
than being part of it, so ``ALL_COMPOUND_BODY_INTRODUCER_TOKENS`` names the
words a status read drops off the front. Both sets match a whole token only, so
``ls done`` and ``echo fi`` name a path and a word rather than a keyword.

Such a compound reports the status of whichever branch ran, not of its last
branch alone, so ``if x; then pytest; else echo skip; fi`` exits with pytest's
code whenever ``x`` succeeds. ``ALL_BRANCH_CONTINUATION_TOKENS`` names ``else``
and ``elif``, the words that open the next branch and so mark the command
before them as the one its own branch ends on.

A redirection binds to the command it follows rather than being part of it, so
``fi 2>&1`` and ``done < list`` still close their compound. Reading the closer
past one means dropping the redirection operator together with the file
descriptor written ahead of it, which ``FILE_DESCRIPTOR_TOKEN_PATTERN`` marks —
``2>&1`` lexes as ``2``, ``>&``, ``1``.

An interpreter takes options of its own before its first operand, and a few of
them carry a separate value: ``ALL_VALUE_TAKING_INTERPRETER_OPTION_FLAGS`` names
those, so ``python -X dev -m pytest`` reads the ``-m`` behind the value while
``python myscript.py -m pytest`` reads the script as the operand that ends the
options. The set covers PyPy's ``--jit`` as well as CPython's own, because the
interpreter pattern takes ``pypy3`` and an unnamed value-taking flag would read
its value as the operand that ends the options.

``PIPE_CHARACTER``, ``COMMENT_START_CHARACTER``, and
``HEREDOC_OPENER_OPERATOR`` are the substrings the hot path tests before it does
the matching parse. Every pipe operator spelling — ``|`` and ``|&`` — carries
``PIPE_CHARACTER``, and no transform in the blocker inserts one, so a command
without it can hold no violation.

A heredoc delimiter is any shell word, so the opener pattern takes one written
bare, quoted, or backslash-escaped (``<<\\EOF`` quotes the delimiter the way
``<<'EOF'`` does). ``<<<`` is a here-string rather than a heredoc, so the
pattern refuses to read one as an opener and leave the lines below it unread.
The opener also reports its own ``-``, because ``<<`` closes on a line spelling
the delimiter exactly while ``<<-`` closes on one carrying leading tabs. It
reports the quote and the backslash separately from the delimiter word, because
either one tells a caller that bash expands nothing inside the body below.

The string-executing shell basenames and command flags start from the shared
``unscoped_search_blocker_constants.py`` sets and add the Windows command shell
(``cmd /c "…"``) on top, locally. Widening the shared sets themselves would hand
``cmd`` unwrapping to ``unscoped_search_blocker`` as a side effect of a
piped-pytest fix, so the addition stays in this module and that blocker keeps
its current behavior.

The operator sets partition ``ALL_SHELL_CONTROL_OPERATOR_TOKENS``. That
derivation covers the operator inventory only; quote-awareness stays local to
the blocker's own lexer.
