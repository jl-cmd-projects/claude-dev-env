"""Constants for the PreToolUse dispatcher that hosts Write/Edit/MultiEdit hooks.

The roster keeps action-boundary checks, repository checks, and checks without
a proven local replacement. File-policy rules with a staged replacement run
through cde lint in native pre-commit. Their detectors stay importable for that
linter. Bash cleanup protection uses its own roster.
