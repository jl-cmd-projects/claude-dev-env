"""PostToolUse dispatcher that hosts the after-write Write/Edit hooks.

Reads the tool payload from stdin once, runs each hosted hook in-process via
runpy in the fixed order declared in the constants module, aggregates the
results, and emits one PostToolUse block decision when any hook blocked
(carrying every blocking reason) or exits zero to allow. When a hosted hook
exits 2, the dispatcher exits 2 after the whole roster runs, and on
PostToolUse the host then shows that hook's stderr to the model.

The hosted hooks keep every side effect they have today: the formatter writes
the reformatted file to disk, and the doc publisher uploads the gist. Running
them in-process preserves those side effects while collapsing three processes
into one. The dispatcher itself performs no file write; it runs the hooks in a
fixed order that reproduces the prior registration order. One hosted hook (the
formatter) does rewrite the edited file mid-sequence, so a later hook reads the
file as the formatter left it — the same order the prior separate entries ran.
