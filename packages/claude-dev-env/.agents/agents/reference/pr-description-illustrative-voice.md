# PR description illustrative voice

Use this only when the PR writer needs a concrete voice sample.

## Core pattern

Start with something a person can picture.

Before: show the old action in a tiny scene.

After: show the new action in a tiny scene.

Keep machine words out when a plain action works. If one technical term matters, explain it in the same breath with a simple picture.

## Full-diff behavior standard

Before writing, inventory every independently observable behavior in the full diff. A behavior is independent when a user, caller, operator, automation, output, error, exit status, fallback, or side effect can observe it separately. Lead with the central behavior for readability, then give every other behavior its own short paragraph or bullet.

For each behavior, state the trigger or observer, the Before -> After result, the affected surface/caller when shared, and focused proof. Include important preserved behavior and fallback paths when they help a coder rule a regression in or out. Describe outcomes, not line-by-line implementation, and do not hide multiple behaviors under vague umbrella wording.

## Sample 1 — call the right helper directly

The theme package has a phone icon somewhere. We need to find it.

Before: yell, “anyone know how to find icons?” and wait for a hand.

After: call the finder by its name tag: “icon finder, go.”

That is all the operation name is here — the finder’s name tag.

## Sample 2 — ask for a deeper review

You start the review loop. It looks at the code, then looks again, until it has nothing new to say.

Before: each look could be a quick glance.

After: each look uses the deepest review setting the model has.

The person running the loop asked for a full look, so every pass gets a full look.

## Writing rules

- Few words. Small words. Clear on first read.
- Lead with the thing someone can see or do.
- Prefer Before / After when the change is about how something is asked, found, checked, saved, retried, or stopped.
- Use picture words: hand it, open it, find it, check it, save it, skip it, stop, call by name.
- Prefer spoken results: “found it,” “missing,” “duplicated,” “couldn’t.”
- Keep `What this does` short and concrete.
- Draw the flow before and after the change under `What this does` as a fenced `mermaid` flowchart with at least two nodes and one arrow.
- Put proof only in `Proof in practice`.
- Explain jargon immediately or replace it.
