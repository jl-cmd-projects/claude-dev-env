## Principle

Publish one GitHub pull request action from validated local files and a
process-local author value. Keep the parent environment unchanged.

## When this applies

Use this skill for one pull request action:

- Create a pull request, ready for review by default or a draft with `--draft`.
- Edit a pull request title or body.
- Add a pull request comment.
- Submit a pull request review.
- Recover one selected legacy author record before the action.

Send issue create, edit, and comment work to the `issue-tracker` skill, one
action at a time. Send review and fix-loop work to `e-code-review`. Make
commits and pushes with Git directly.

Require one repository and one action target. Stop before author lookup or
network work when the repository, pull request, action, author, or required
local file is missing or ambiguous.

Use these exact refusal responses when the request belongs to another skill:

- Issue action: `Use issue-tracker for this GitHub issue action.`
- Commit or push: `Use Git directly for this commit or push.`
- Missing target: `Provide one repository and one pull request action target.`

## Constraints

- Run local validation and privacy checks before account lookup or network work.
- Use a body file. Do not send inline body text through the shell.
- Keep `GITHUB_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`, the parent environment, and global GitHub CLI
  state unchanged.
- Run one create, edit, comment, review, or recovery action per command.
- Use global account switching only for one explicitly selected legacy record.
- Read back the remote state before reporting success.

## Dependencies

The commands use Python 3.11 or later and the Python standard library. GitHub
actions also require an authenticated `gh` executable. The linter and artifact
uploader ship in this package. Set `GITHUB_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` to one exact GitHub
CLI login when the action needs a selected author. Leave it unset to use the
current process environment.

## Sub-skills

| Skill | When | Produces | If missing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pstack:poteto-agent` with `pull-request` instructions | Create or a full body rewrite, when you want the body drafted for you | A reviewed title and body file | Write the title and body yourself |
| `privacy-hygiene` | Before any durable GitHub post | A clean body and repository privacy sweep | Stop before publication and report the missing gate |
| `issue-tracker` | Issue create, edit, or comment requests | Issue state and issue URLs | Route the request there. |
| `e-code-review` | Review or review/fix loop requests | Structured findings or a clean review result | Route the request there. |

## Task seeding

When the session exposes a task tool, register the items in
`reference/publication-tasks.md` as session tasks. Otherwise work through the
Process steps in order.

## Process

### 1. Scope the action

Resolve the repository, action, and selected GitHub author. For create, resolve
the source branch, base, and head. For other actions, resolve one existing pull
request target. Create publishes a ready pull request, and `--draft` publishes a
draft. Record the target before any write.

### 2. Author the title and body

For create and full body rewrite, write the title and a body file, or invoke
`pstack:poteto-agent` with the diff-specific writing instructions to draft
them. A comment or
review may use a supplied body file when it does not rewrite the pull request
description.

Check each behavior claim against the final diff and verification evidence.
Preserve whether a rule is added, removed, or narrowed, and distinguish tests
added from tests run. Refresh these claims after a rebase or correction.

Open with the concrete problem and resulting behavior in one or two short
paragraphs of plain prose. Write for a reviewer who has not read the worker's
conversation. Include only claims supported by the final diff. State commands,
results, and material limits under `## Verification`.

Keep substantive review and test evidence. Put extensive logs, raw diffs, token
counts, and agent transcripts in an existing linked artifact or a closed
`<details>` section after the primary explanation. Let justified evidence grow
without a total-length cap. A collapsed transcript still needs a useful opening.

Load a repository's PR-description skill and run the checker command it supplies.
Apply these steps to automated publishers too. A green code check proves no
description claim by itself.

### 3. Run the local linter

Resolve the active managed root (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set, `~/.claude`
otherwise), then run `<managed-root>/scripts/durable_post_lint.py` with the
matching action and title or body file. Use `pr-create`, `pr-edit`, `pr-comment`,
or `pr-review`. The linter owns the action-specific body, title, and
volatile-path rules.

Exit code `0` continues to the next gate. Any non-zero exit stops the action. Fix
the named local input and rerun the linter. Do not look up the author or make a
network call while validation fails.

### 4. Run privacy and artifact checks

Invoke `privacy-hygiene` before the GitHub post. Upload binary evidence with
`scripts/gh_artifact_upload.py` and replace local artifact references with
permanent URLs. Rerun the linter after changing the body.

### 5. Resolve the process-local author

Run `~/.agents/skills/pull-request/scripts/pull_request.py` (under the agents
home, not the repository; a worktree holds no `.agents/` copy) with one
structured action and the selected author. The command runs the linter again, resolves
the author value, and passes it only to the child `gh` process. It never
changes the parent environment or calls `gh auth switch`.

If the selected author has no usable value, stop and report the account lookup
failure. Never print the value.

### 6. Recover a selected legacy record

Run `.agents/skills/pull-request/scripts/recover_legacy_author.py
<exact-state-file> --confirm-inactive` only when the user selects one legacy
state file. The command checks the record's age, secure file metadata, and
contents. The confirmation flag records that the caller verified inactivity.
Leave every other record untouched. Delete the selected record only after a
successful restore. Mark this step `N/A` when no legacy state file is selected.

### 7. Run the action

Run `pull_request.py` for exactly one of `create`, `edit`, `comment`, or
`review`. Supply the validated body file path. Treat a non-zero exit as a
failed publication and preserve the local inputs for retry.

### 8. Read back the remote state

Use the same selected process-local author for a read-only remote readback.
Confirm the pull request URL and number, title, body, head SHA, and draft state.
For comments and reviews, confirm the new remote entry. Report artifact URLs
without exposing author values.

Confirm the published claims still describe the verified head and preserve the
scope of its evidence, including whether checks used saved artifacts or a new run.
Read the remote opening with evidence sections collapsed. Confirm that it explains
the change on its own and that the evidence links lead to the cited results.

## Exit handling

Stop before network work when authoring, local validation, privacy, or author
selection fails. A failed action preserves its body and any recovery record.
Report the generic error and the next required input. A successful action ends
only after remote readback proves the requested state.

## Examples

Create example: the writer produces `pr-body.md`. The linter exits `0` for
`pr-create`. `pull_request.py create` publishes one ready pull request. The
readback matches the title, body, head SHA, and draft state.

Rejected comment example: the comment body names a worktree file. The linter
returns a non-zero exit. No account lookup or GitHub request runs. Replace the
path with inline text or a permanent artifact URL, then rerun.

Recovery example: one old record remains after an interrupted legacy account
swap. The user selects that exact file and confirms its session is inactive.
The recovery command restores the named account and deletes only that record.

## Gotchas

- Relative body-file paths depend on the caller directory. Use an absolute path
  when another process or worktree starts the command.
- A record older than 30 minutes can still belong to a live session. Require
  `--confirm-inactive` before recovery.
- Normal pull request actions never call `gh auth switch`. If that command
  appears outside explicit recovery, stop.
- GitHub CLI output can contain account data. The command captures account
  lookup and recovery output and prints only generic errors.
