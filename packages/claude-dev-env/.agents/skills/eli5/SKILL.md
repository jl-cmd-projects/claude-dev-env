## Principle

Explain the current topic for a complete beginner with plain language, large
visuals, and very few words. Keep the explanation concise, friendly, useful,
self-contained, and browser-ready.

ELI5 owns the HTML presentation envelope. Use one stable self-contained HTML
artifact for the active task or conversation. Keep update-in-place continuity as
the conversation continues, and share the current artifact after each update.

## When this applies

Apply ELI5 to every user-facing response, including responses that present a
capability-specific artifact. Raw tool output, machine payloads, code, and
native repository artifacts retain their required formats. Present their human
explanation inside the HTML presentation envelope when the response is user-facing.

## Skill classification

**Dominant type:** Business Process & Team Automation.

**Folder rationale:** `SKILL.md` holds the global artifact workflow, and
`reference/task-seeds.md` holds its ordered session tasks. The leaf keeps its
presentation capability local.

## Authority boundaries

| Owner | Owns | ELI5 action |
|---|---|---|
| ELI5 | Beginner framing, visual expectation, minimal content, HTML continuity, and sharing | Keep the response in one useful, stable artifact. |
| `~/.claude/rules/asd-ste100-language.md` | Word choice, sentence structure, terminology, punctuation, procedural instructions, and safety text | Read and apply it before writing or updating any page or response prose. |
| The named capability skill | Native data, evidence, workflow, and file-format requirements | Preserve its contract inside the HTML presentation envelope. |
| User instructions and safety requirements | Task boundary, audience, confidentiality, and permitted result | Treat them as the controlling scope for the page. |
| Human review | Technical accuracy, terminology, safety, confidentiality, intended meaning, and rendered usefulness | Review the completed artifact before delivery. |

## Composition boundary

ELI5 is a leaf skill. Explanation and visual composition remain one user-facing
capability. ELI5 invokes zero presentation sub-skills. Named capability skills
keep ownership of their native artifact rules while ELI5 supplies the global
 HTML presentation envelope.

## Gotchas

- Keep the HTML presentation envelope active when another capability skill creates the page.
- Keep sentence-level prose under `~/.claude/rules/asd-ste100-language.md`.
- Preserve an explicit user-supplied output path and an existing artifact path.
- Keep one artifact path across all updates in the active task or conversation.
- Keep every page self-contained and browser-ready.
- Give every source change a card in a digest. The reader reads less and still
  knows every change, so a dropped change is a defect.
- Preserve native wrapper, payload, evidence, and file-format contracts owned by
  the named capability skill.
- Use human review for accuracy, terminology, safety, confidentiality, meaning,
  and rendered legibility.

## Task seeding

When the session exposes a task tool, register the items in
`reference/task-seeds.md` as session tasks. Otherwise work through the
Process steps in order.

## Process

1. **Deterministic — locate the current HTML artifact or create the first one.** Find the active
   artifact, preserve an explicit user path, or create a clear self-contained
   browser-ready HTML artifact when no path exists. Keep the chosen path for the
   rest of the active task or conversation.
2. **Deterministic — list the cases the user named.** When the request lists
   cases, count each variant as its own case and keep the user's numbering,
   such as 3a and 3b for a case that holds a draft and a ready variant. Give
   each case its own card and its own visual.
3. **Borderline — add the current explanation to that artifact.** Read and apply
   `~/.claude/rules/asd-ste100-language.md` to every sentence. Frame the topic
   for a beginner, use a large useful visual, keep the text minimal, and update
   the same artifact in place.
4. **Deterministic — run the digest check on a summary of many changes.** A
   summary of a set of changes, such as the pull requests merged in a day, is a
   digest. Give each change one card marked `data-digest-card="<id>"` that holds
   its picture and its one-line change. Pass every source id to the check:

   ```bash
   python "$HOME/.claude/scripts/digest_check.py" <page.html> --expect <id> <id>
   ```

   The check reports each source id with no card, each card over 25 words, each
   card without a picture, and more than 40 words outside the cards. Fix every
   finding and run it again until it prints `CLEAN`.
5. **Judgment — share the updated artifact with the user.**

### Examples

- **Creation:** Input — `Explain DNS for a beginner` with no artifact path.
  Output — `dns-explanation.html` with one self-contained page and a large visual.
- **Update and share:** Input — `Add why DNS caching helps` in the same
  conversation. Output — the same `dns-explanation.html` path updated and shared.
