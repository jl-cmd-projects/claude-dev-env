  Diagnose Windows Codex desktop/CLI startup with fresh read-only process evidence. Use when Codex will not start on Windows, or a Codex process looks stuck, stale, or suspended.

# Recovering Codex startup

## Principle

Collect a fresh, read-only process listing before you say Codex is stuck, stale, or running.
Report only what that listing supports. Do not change process or installation state.

## Gotchas

- A process name alone does not prove that Codex is the affected process.
- Report the executable path, process name, start time, and owner. Mark unavailable fields as unavailable.
- Do not inspect other applications, process trees, or change process state.
- Do not call a process stale or suspended without fresh supporting evidence.
- Run `/privacy-hygiene` before durable output.

## When this applies

Use this skill only for Windows Codex desktop or CLI startup diagnosis.

For a non-Windows run, return exactly:
`This runbook supports Windows Codex startup recovery only.`

## Process

1. When the session exposes a task tool, register the tasks in `reference/task-seeds.md`.
2. Read `../../../docs/rule-guides/verify-runtime-state.md`.
3. Confirm Windows and collect a fresh timestamp.
4. Use read-only Windows tools to inspect Codex processes only.
5. Record process name, executable path, start time, and owner.
6. Separate observation from diagnosis and state when no match exists.
7. Run `/privacy-hygiene` before saving or publishing a report.

Do not change process or installation state. A human must authorize any later
process or installation change.
