# Extra account workers

Use this skill when a task needs a local Claude worker and the session should
save main account usage.

## Configure extra profiles

Run `claude_account_profile.py --profile-name NAME` for each extra profile.
The script creates `<profiles root>/NAME` and the `claude-NAME.cmd` launcher.
Running it again with the same name leaves the profile and launcher in place.

To set worker order, put `extra-profiles.json` in the main Claude home. Write a
JSON list of profile names, with the first choice first. Names use letters,
digits, hyphens, and underscores. The worker uses the existing second profile
when the file is absent. When the file exists, its list sets the full order.
Keep `main` and `wait` out of the list because they name picker decisions.
The picker ranks main and every extra profile by room left and picks the one
with the most.
For direct picker calls, `--second-config-dir` sets the first extra profile and
each `--extra-config-dir` adds another in the order given.
Picker JSON prints `config_dir` for the choice and meters under `main`, `second`,
`extra_2`, and later labels.

## Choose a worker

Keep the Agent tool for small, fast lookups. For any worker that edits code,
researches at length, or runs long, give it its own Git worktree, write a
standalone brief to a file, and launch the account worker in the background.

```bash
python "$HOME/.claude/scripts/claude_account_worker.py" \
  --prompt-file "<brief>" \
  --cwd "<worktree>" \
  --report-file "<report>" \
  >"<worker-log>" 2>&1 &
worker_pid=$!
wait "$worker_pid"
worker_exit=$?
cat "<report>"
```

Read the JSON report and worker log after the process ends. The JSON fields are
`account`, `reason`, `exit_code`, `duration_seconds`, `result`, and `is_error`.
The runner writes one summary line with the selected account, exit code, and
report path.

When the command exits 3 and the report has `"account": "wait"`, no account is
eligible. Report the picker's reason and reset time. Do not fall back to the
Agent tool. Claude can also return exit 3 after a worker starts. When the
report account is `main`, `second`, or `extra_2` and later, report the child's
exit code and result. Exit 124 with reason `timeout` means the worker ran past
`--timeout-minutes`.

Workers never commit, push, or call `gh`. The calling session reviews each
worktree diff and owns every Git step.

## Write a standalone brief

When pstack is installed, the first brief line is `/pstack:poteto-mode`.
Otherwise, begin with the worker role. Include every detail needed to finish
without the calling session's conversation.

```text
/pstack:poteto-mode
Role: <one worker duty>
Owned files: <exact paths this worker may edit>
Acceptance checks:
- <observable behavior>
- <commands to run and expected result>
Report:
Changed: <files and reason>
Proof: <checks run and last result lines>
Blocked: <open issue, or none>
```

Keep the owned file list closed. Name the worktree path with `--cwd` and use a
separate brief and report path for each worker.
