# CI Owns the Gate

**When this applies:** Before pushing a branch, and any time a repository's full
check suite or policy gate is about to run on your own machine.

## Rule

The gate runs once, and it runs on CI. Push the branch, read the verdict, act on
what it says.

The inner development loop stays yours. Run the single test you are writing, as
often as it helps. That is how the change gets built. This rule governs the
second full pass, the one whose only product is a prediction of CI's answer.
Push instead, and spend the wait on the next piece of work.

## Why

**A pinned gate answers only from its pinned revision.** The workflow names an
exact revision of the policy package, and that revision decides which rules run.
The copy under your home directory is a separate artifact at its own revision. A
run against the home copy reports on those rules, which are a different question
from the one CI asks. Treat its exit code as information about the home copy
alone.

**Self-hosted runners often share your machine.** Where the runners execute on
the same host as your shell, a local suite run draws its processor time from the
runners, and it does so while they work on the branch you just pushed. Read
where the runners live, and count a local run against the same budget.

**One authoritative answer beats two.** Where both runs agree, the second one
restated the first. Where they differ, the environments differ, and CI is the
environment that decides.

## Running a gate locally

Clone the revision the workflow pins, then point the gate at that clone. That
run asks CI's question and its answer carries. Report a local result by naming
the revision it used, so a reader can tell which question it answered.

The selection flag decides which question the staged policy lint answers.
`--staged` and `--base <revision>` carry each file's prior text, so the lint
subtracts what the prior text already reported and only a breach the change
introduced survives. `--files` and `--repository` carry no prior text, so every
breach in the file reports and the command exits non-zero on debt the change
never touched. CI runs the merge-base form, so reproduce a CI verdict with it:

```
git merge-base HEAD origin/main
python packages/claude-dev-env/scripts/cde_lint.py --base <the revision that printed>
```

A `--files` run that comes back red on a file you touched has answered a
different question. Read the reported line before you treat it as yours.

## The verdict belongs to CI

CI decides whether a change passed, from evidence CI gathered. Keep that loop
closed. A flag, trailer, receipt, or environment variable through which the
change under test announces its own result hands the verdict to the subject.
Where the runner and the agent share one host, a signature names the same party
twice, so it carries the claim no further.

A cache stays available on one condition. CI derives the key itself from the
tree it is about to test, looks for a previous run under that key, and
republishes that result. CI computes, CI verifies, CI decides.

## A repository that runs no CI

An owner can rule that a repository spends no CI minutes. There the local gate
is the gate, and the agent that drives the pull request runs it on every head
it asks to merge. The repository carries the gate as a `cde verify` manifest at
`.claude/local-gate.json`: tests with collection floors, and lint.

1. Check out the pull request head with a clean tree and fetch its base.
2. Run the manifest against the base commit the pull request names:

   ```
   python <cde>/scripts/local_verification/cli.py --manifest .claude/local-gate.json --repo . --base <base sha> --output <outside the repository>/report.json
   ```

3. Publish the report:

   ```
   python <cde>/scripts/local_report_publisher.py --token-environment GH_TOKEN --repository <owner>/<name> --pull-number <number> --local-repo . --manifest .claude/local-gate.json --report <outside the repository>/report.json
   ```

The publisher checks the report against the manifest digest, the clean tree,
and the live head and base, then posts the `local-checks` commit status. A
report that fails any of those posts a failure or an error. The branch ruleset
lists `local-checks` as a required status check, so the host refuses a merge
until a passing report covers the head, and `agent_merge_check.py` prints
`HOLD` on the same requirement. A push moves the head and leaves the status
behind, so each new head runs the gate again.

## Sibling rules

| Rule | Role |
|---|---|
| [`git-workflow.md`](git-workflow.md) | Confirm each required context fired after the push |
| [`verify-runtime-state.md`](verify-runtime-state.md) | A status field is a report; read the thing the work was meant to make |
| [`falsify-before-green.md`](falsify-before-green.md) | A green counts as evidence once the check has run red on a deliberate break |
