"""Find contrast framing in authored prose.

A contrast defines its subject against a rejected alternative, so the reader
carries two readings where one would do.

::

    all_hits = find_contrast_framing("A diff regression, not shared code.")
    ok:   all_hits == [(1, 18, "trailing-comma-not")]
    flag: find_contrast_framing("The function runs more than 30 lines.") == []

Code spans, fenced blocks, paths, and link targets are blanked before the
patterns run, so an example quoted in backticks stays quiet. A blockquote line
is skipped, since it carries someone else's words. A comma-``not`` match
reports only when no bare ``not`` already sits earlier in the line, so a
second one in a list stays quiet, and a list that opens with ``not`` keeps
even its first comma quiet. The pattern list lives in the constants module
beside this one, and the durable post linter reads the same list.
