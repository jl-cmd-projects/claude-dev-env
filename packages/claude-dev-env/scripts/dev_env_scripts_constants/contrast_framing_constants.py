"""Constants for the contrast-framing detector.

Each form names one shape a sentence takes when it defines its subject
against a rejected reading::

    "a diff regression, not shared code"   -> trailing-comma-not
    "park it rather than fix it"           -> substitution-rather-than
    "precision matters more than coverage" -> comparative-ranking
    ok: "the function runs more than 30 lines"

The rule file ``rules/no-contrast-framing.md`` names each form here in
backticks, and a test holds the two in step.
