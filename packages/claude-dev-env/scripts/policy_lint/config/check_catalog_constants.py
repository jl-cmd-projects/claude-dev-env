"""The message markers that name which check inside a bundling rule spoke.

Most lint rules run one check, so their rule identifier already names the
check. Two rules bundle many checks behind one identifier, and a consumer that
classifies a finding by severity needs to know which of them raised it. Each
entry below pairs a stable fragment of a check's message with the name that
identifies the check.
