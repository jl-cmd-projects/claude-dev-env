"""Decide whether a review finding on a pull request head is answered.

A review bot posts a finding, the agent driving the pull request answers it or
pushes the fix, and the thread closes. Until then the finding waits. These
functions read the review threads, the top-level comments on the pull request,
and the approvals conclusion, and name what waits.

::

    thread: a bot comment, nothing after it     -> open
    thread: a bot comment, then an agent reply  -> closed
    thread: a bot comment, code since replaced  -> closed
    thread: a red circle, resolved in silence   -> open
    top-level: a bot comment, no agent comment  -> open
    top-level: a bot comment, then an agent one -> closed
    top-level: the bot edits after that reply   -> closed
    top-level: a person edits after that reply  -> open

A red circle marks a finding a review states as blocking, so resolution alone
leaves it open. The reply says what changed, or why the finding stands.
A review bot rewrites its summary comment on each pass, and any new finding it
has arrives as a review thread or a new comment, so its edit alone reopens
nothing.
