description: Fix every non-breaking finding the follow-up ledger holds and open a PR for it
argument-hint: [repository root, or blank for the current repository]
---

Fix the non-breaking findings a local gate recorded rather than blocked on,
and deliver them as one pull request.

The repository root is `$ARGUMENTS`, or the current repository when that is
blank.

Use `docs/rule-guides/asd-ste100-language.md` for user-facing wording.

## 1. Read the ledger

Run `cde followup brief --repository-root <root>`.

When it prints `no follow-ups recorded`, report that and stop. There is no
work.

Otherwise the brief lists one line per finding, each carrying the check
identifier, the file, the message, and the revision the finding was recorded
against.

## 2. Group the findings

Group the lines by check identifier. A check with several findings takes one
pass over every file it names, so the same fix shape lands once.

A finding whose check identifier ends in `unclassified` comes from a check the
catalog does not name yet. Fix it like any other, and add its entry to
`scripts/policy_lint/config/check_catalog_constants.py` with a sample in the
catalog's synchronization test.

Read each named file before editing it. A recorded finding names the state of
the file at the moment the gate ran, so confirm the finding still holds.
Keep a finding the current file still carries. Drop the rest.

## 3. Fix each group

Each finding is non-breaking, so the change that raised it already shipped.
Keep every fix mechanical. Touch no behavior, change no signature, and add no
abstraction.

Run the repository's own fast checks over the files you changed. Where a
finding names a generated file, regenerate it with the repository's tooling.

## 4. Open the pull request

Branch from the repository's default branch. Commit each group on its own,
with a message naming the check identifier and the files.

Open the pull request ready for review. Write the body as:

- One `Before:` paragraph saying which findings stood open.
- One `After:` paragraph saying what the tree now holds.
- A short `How` paragraph naming the groups, the files each touched, and the
  revisions the findings were recorded against.

Push, then confirm the required checks report on the branch head.

## 5. Empty the ledger

Once the pull request is open, run
`cde followup clear --repository-root <root>`.

A finding the pull request left alone goes back in the ledger with
`cde followup ingest`, so the next pass picks it up.

## Report

Name the pull request link, the groups fixed, the findings dropped because
the current file reads clean, and anything left in the ledger.
