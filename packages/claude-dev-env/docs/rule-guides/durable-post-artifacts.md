# GitHub post input rules

Full text behind [`rules/durable-post-artifacts.md`](../../rules/durable-post-artifacts.md).

## When this applies

Use this rule for a GitHub issue, pull request, comment, or review created
through `gh` or a GitHub MCP post tool. The image section also covers a PNG a
commit adds and a file a release upload sends.

## Rule

A post remains after the job ends. Job scratch directories, worktrees, and
system temp folders do not. Do not put a path from one of those directories in
a post.

Handle text and binary content differently:

- **Text data** such as logs, tables, diffs, and stack traces belongs inline in
  the post body. Do not link a scratch file that holds text data.
- **Binary artifacts** such as images, screenshots, and archives belong in the
  repository's durable `artifacts` release. Use the helper:

  ```
  python3 ~/.claude/scripts/gh_artifact_upload.py <file-path> <owner/repo>
  ```

  The helper creates the `artifacts` prerelease when needed, uploads the file
  under a `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<name>` asset name, and prints a permanent download
  URL. Put that URL in the post.

## Optimize every image before it reaches GitHub

The helper shrinks a PNG with [oxipng](https://github.com/oxipng/oxipng) before
it uploads, and prints the size before and after. Oxipng is lossless.
`--strip none` keeps every chunk, and `--nb --nc` keep the bit depth and the
color type, so a reader that checks the image mode sees the same file shape.

Any other route to GitHub runs the same pass first: a PNG a commit adds, and a
file sent with `gh release upload`.

```
oxipng --opt 4 --strip none --nb --nc <file> [<file> ...]
```

The `Binary optimization` check fails a pull request whose changed PNG files
still shrink under that pass. A fixture whose exact bytes a test pins takes
`binary-optimizer=keep` in `.gitattributes`, and the check skips it.

## Volatile paths that must not appear in a post body

- A job scratch directory: `.claude-profile-a/jobs/`
- A worktree: `.claude/worktrees/`
- A system temp location: `AppData\\Local\\Temp`, `%TEMP%`, `$env:TEMP`, or
  `/tmp/`
- The job scratch environment variable: `$CLAUDE_JOB_DIR`

Both slash directions count. The path rule applies when a slash or backslash
precedes a marker, or when a path segment follows it. A standalone directory
name does not form a path.

## Validation

Resolve the active managed root (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set, `~/.claude`
otherwise), then run `<managed-root>/scripts/durable_post_lint.py` before the
server write. Pass the matching action and body file. Use `pr-create`,
`pr-edit`, `pr-comment`, `pr-review`, `issue-create`, `issue-edit`,
`issue-comment`, or `github-mcp-post`.

Pass `--repository <owner>/<name>` for the repository the post targets. A
post may name a private organization only inside a repository that
organization owns. The same digests cover the owner's private repository, the
owner's personal handle, and a private client. The linter holds the names as
digests, so it reports the line that names one without printing the name.
Describe the name in general terms and drop the link.

The linter reads the body file and reports a volatile local path without
printing the body. Fix the body and rerun the linter before posting.
