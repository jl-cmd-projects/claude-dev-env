# Anti-Corollary Tests

Full text behind [`rules/anti-corollary-tests.md`](../../rules/anti-corollary-tests.md).

**When this applies:** Any Write or Edit that adds or changes tests.

## Rule

A large green suite can prove almost nothing. Before you keep a case, answer three questions. If any answer fails, cut the case or replace it with one that carries information.

## The three questions

### 1. Is this a corollary?

When the code reduces each input to a canonical form and then compares the forms, every pairwise combination of input spellings follows once the reduction is proven canonical. Walking the full N×N matrix restates that fact. It adds cases and runtime, and it buries the few cases that carry information.

**Do this:** test the reduction once. Test the comparison with a few discriminating cases. Do not walk the cross product of spellings.

### 2. Could this test pass if the mechanism were dead?

Name the degenerate value a dead implementation would return — empty string, `None`, `False`, a blanket refusal, an empty collection. When the test's expected value equals that default, the test passes whether the mechanism works or not. On its own it proves nothing.

**Do this:** keep at least one case that expects the **non-default** answer, and drive the production code path — not a mock that only records that a call happened.

### 3. What single change to the code would make this test fail?

When the honest answer is "none," or "only a change that also breaks everything else," the test is decoration. Drop it or rewrite it so one named mutation kills it.

**The policy-surface case.** A test that asserts a policy's own wording appears in the file that declares the policy has one mutation available: editing that sentence. It cannot report whether anything obeys the policy, so a suite full of such tests measures how many files repeat a rule, which is the duplication the reader was already complaining about. Assert instead that the surfaces the policy governs comply with it, and let the declaring file be the input rather than the subject.

## What a mechanism with a degenerate failure mode needs

1. **At least one non-default case** that exercises the live path and expects the non-default answer.
2. **A stated mutation (audit lane):** name one specific change to the code and record how many tests it kills. A mutation that kills zero tests means the suite proves nothing. A reviewer or an audit skill checks this; a hook does not compute it.
3. **A few discriminating cases** in place of a large matrix.

## Worked shape (sanitized)

A write guard decides whether a write is about to hit a production database. It reduces each database URL to a canonical endpoint identity, then compares identities.

Two independent mutations show the two halves of a useful suite:

- Gut the reduction so it always returns the empty string: the guard fails **closed** and refuses everything. Only the *allow*-expecting cases die.
- Abandon the reduction and compare raw hostnames: the guard fails **open** and allows a production write. Only the *refuse*-expecting cases die.

Opposite breaks kill opposite halves. A suite with only one half cannot see one of those breaks. Build both halves; skip the spelling matrix once the reduction is covered.

## What this is not

A structural hook is the wrong tool here. "Is this a corollary?" and "would this pass against a dead implementation?" need the intent of the code under test. A hook that pattern-matches `parametrize` breadth or counts assertions fires on correct suites and trains people to ignore it. A false-positive gate on a judgment call is worse than no gate. This rule stays judgment-only, with the stated-mutation check in the audit lane — the same pattern as other judgment rules in this package that have no Write/Edit blocker.

## Sibling rules

| Rule | Role |
|---|---|
| `code-standards.md` | Points at CODE_RULES §8: write a failing test before production code |
| `testing.md` | Mocks and test infrastructure standards |
| `paired-test-coverage.md` | Every public function in an established suite gets a behavioral test |
| `anti-corollary-tests.md` | Each test carries information; no corollary matrices; no suite that only matches the dead default |

## Enforcement

The AI review lane and audit skills carry this rule: an agent applies it to the test lines a PR changes. No blocking hook backs it, because corollary and dead-default judgments need meaning a regex cannot read.
