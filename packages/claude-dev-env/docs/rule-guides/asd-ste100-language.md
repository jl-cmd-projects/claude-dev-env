# ASD-STE100 language policy

Use this rule as the sole general language authority for user-facing text in this repository.
It defines ordinary word choice, sentence style, tone, punctuation, and prose form.

This text is an **ASD-STE100 Issue 9 conversational adaptation**. It applies the standard's
clear-writing principles to assistant messages. The official standard remains the authority for
definitions and dictionary decisions.

## Writing policy

- Write short, complete sentences. Keep one topic in each explanatory sentence.
- Use active voice. Put the condition first when an instruction has a prerequisite.
- Write imperative procedure steps. Give one action in each sentence.
- Prefer familiar, precise words. Use one stable term for one item or action.
- Write full words and explicit references. Expand abbreviations and contractions when they first appear.
- Replace ambiguous pronouns with the noun they name.
- Use inclusive, neutral language.
- Use periods, commas, colons, and bullets to show structure.
- Preserve exact quoted labels, identifiers, formulas, titles, and interface text.
- Send the reader only a result, a blocker, or a question. Leave out a line that says nothing is needed from them, and leave out which agent, session, or coordinator did the work.
- Use `WARNING` for a risk of injury or death. Use `CAUTION` for a risk of equipment, tool, or machine damage. State the command or condition first, then state the result.
- Aim for 20 words or fewer in a procedure sentence when the technical content allows.
- Aim for 25 words or fewer in a descriptive sentence when the technical content allows.

Use this policy for chat, tool narration, questions, plans, documentation, code-adjacent prose,
and durable repository text. Named contracts can add behavior-specific structure, evidence,
question routing, current-state documentation, completion, docstring, or publication rules.
Those contracts use this policy for their language.

Treat automated output and language checks as drafting aids. A responsible human verifies
technical accuracy, terminology, safety, confidentiality, and intended meaning.
