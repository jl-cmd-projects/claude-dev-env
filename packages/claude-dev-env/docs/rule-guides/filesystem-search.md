# Filesystem search

**When this applies:** Any search for files by name, path, extension, size, or date. That includes `es.exe`, a shell `find`, a recursive `Get-ChildItem` / `gci` / `dir` / `ls -R`, or the harness Grep and Glob tools.

## The scope invariant

Every filesystem search names a scope. A scope is a project, worktree, or package directory under the work in progress, or a filter that narrows the walk: an `ext:` filter, a `dm:` date filter, a `size:` filter, or a name pattern.

A search that starts at the filesystem root, a drive root, bare home, or a network share is out of bounds. Narrow it to what you need.

## Choosing a tool

Three tools are equally sanctioned; pick by what you know:

| You know | Use |
|---|---|
| The exact path | `Read`. Do not search. |
| A name, extension, or date, on Windows | `es.exe` with a path scope |
| A name or path pattern | The harness `Glob` tool |
| Text inside files | The harness `Grep` tool |

When `es.exe` returns Error 8, retry the same search twice before any fallback. Error 8 is a missing IPC client window, not proof the index is down. After those retries fail, report that the Everything IPC client did not answer and that the service state was not probed, then fall back to `Glob` or `Grep` with the same scope. When `es.exe` is missing, or a later search returns no hits, fall back to `Glob` or `Grep`. Ask the user only after all three tools fail.

`skills/everything-search/SKILL.md` holds the full `es.exe` operator reference: `ext:`, `dm:`, `size:`, wildcards, OR/AND/NOT, output flags, and the junction and drive-mapping note.

## Allowed and denied shapes

| Allowed | Example |
|---|---|
| Cwd-relative | `find . -iname '*.py'` |
| Project path | `find packages/claude-dev-env -name code_rules_gate.py` |
| Git Bash scoped path | `find /c/Users/<you>/repo -iname SKILL.md` |
| Recursive listing under a project | `Get-ChildItem -Path .\src -Recurse` |
| Scoped Windows index search | `es.exe path:C:\dev\repo ext:py gate` |

| Denied | Example |
|---|---|
| Filesystem root | `find / -iname code_rules_gate.py` |
| Git Bash drive root | `find /c -name '*.py'` |
| Windows drive root | `find C:\ -name foo` / `Get-ChildItem C:\ -Recurse` |
| Bare home | `find ~ -name README.md` / `find $HOME -type f` |
| Network share root | `find //server/share -name x`. A path under the share (`//server/share/project/src`) is allowed |

## Shell batching

Issue one shell search at a time when the walk is large. Parallel full-tree searches contend for the shell and can lock the host. Harness `Grep` and `Glob` calls carry no such cost and run in parallel freely.

## Search controls

- No hook denies a walk from an unscoped root. The scope invariant above is guidance a reader follows.
- For Everything searches that use a project name, run `python "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/everything_search.py" <project-name> <search arguments>`. An exact project name becomes its path from `~/.claude/project-paths.json`. The command then starts `es.exe` without a shell. `scripts/setup_project_paths.py` writes the registry.
