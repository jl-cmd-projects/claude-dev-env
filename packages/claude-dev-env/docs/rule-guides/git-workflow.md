# Git workflow

Full text behind [`rules/git-workflow.md`](../../rules/git-workflow.md).

User-level rule: applies to **every** git repo that uses GitHub with `gh`. Small or non-primary repos follow the same rule unless the user says otherwise in the session.

## Workflow decision tree

**When to use stacked PRs:** Feature B depends on Feature A's implementation

**When to extract shared infrastructure first:** Multiple features need same utilities/helpers

**Extract Shared Infrastructure Pattern:**
1. Create infrastructure PR with only shared code
2. Get reviewed and MERGE infrastructure first
3. Launch parallel feature PRs that use merged infrastructure

## Pull request submission rules

**Open every pull request ready for review.** Pass `--draft` only when the owner asks
for a draft.

**A release bot's PR body is machine input. Leave it alone.** Release automation reads
back the body of its own merged pull request to decide it owns that merge. Rewriting the
body, or trimming its header or footer, makes the bot treat the merge as somebody else's
work: it cuts no tag, the publish job skips, and it opens one more release pull request on
the next run. The merge stays in the repository. No tag is cut and the package never publishes.

Spot one by its head branch, which starts `release-please--branches--`, or by a body that
opens with the bot's own marker line. The description rules in this file, the
`pstack:poteto-agent` writing brief, and the house wording style all step aside for it. The
failure signature in the release job log reads
`could not parse pull request body as a release PR`.

`pstack:poteto-agent` writes a title and body from the diff when you want one.
Publish the title and body file through
`~/.agents/skills/pull-request/scripts/pull_request.py`. That path is under the
agents home, not the repository. A worktree holds no `.agents/` copy.

Resolve the active managed root (`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set, `~/.claude`
otherwise), then run `<managed-root>/scripts/durable_post_lint.py` before any
pull request, issue, or GitHub MCP post. The linter checks the action-specific
title, body, and volatile-path rules before credential lookup or network
access.

Use `.agents/skills/pull-request/scripts/recover_legacy_author.py
<exact-state-file> --confirm-inactive` only for one explicitly selected legacy
author record. Do not infer a record from age alone. Keep every other record
untouched.

## Confirm the required checks fired, and let CI run them

The gate runs once, and it runs on CI. Push the branch and read its verdict.
[`ci-owns-the-gate.md`](../../rules/ci-owns-the-gate.md) holds the reasoning and the shape
a local run takes when one is warranted.

Read the branch ruleset for the required check contexts before you push a
branch, or any level of a stack: `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/rules/branches/<trunk>`.
Read it to learn which checks must report. After the push, confirm each of those
contexts appears on that level's head. A required check that never fired is
invisible debt at every level, and it surfaces only after the whole stack is
pushed, when the repair costs a second pass over every branch.

A red required check blocks the branch, whoever owns the failing line. The
staged policy lint grades a change against the file's prior text, so a finding
that survives is one the change introduced or made worse. Fix that line in the
next push or report the branch blocked. A finding the change did not introduce
is a gate-scoping defect: report it against the lint and leave the file's shape
alone. Restructuring a file to satisfy a mis-scoped check trades one finding for
a set of new ones. Read the gate's own report rather than a narrower substitute. A
single-file mypy call cannot see sibling modules and reports false import
errors, so it neither clears nor convicts a change.

A checks listing that reports nothing on the branch is a finding, not a neutral
state. Find out whether the workflow's event filters exclude the branch, or whether
the check simply never ran, before you treat that branch as clean.

## Each stack level stands on its own

A symbol belongs at the level that first **uses** it, not the level that first
mentions it. A bottom pull request that declares the imports its descendants will
need fails the linter on unused imports. A test helper that calls a function three
levels above it fails on an undefined name. Both defects stay invisible while you
read the finished tip, and both are obvious the moment you check one level alone.

Prove each level before you push it: import the modules that level changes, and run
the required linter against that level's own base. To repair a level, rebuild its
import header as the union of what that level references, let the linter's
autofix strip the rest, and move a premature helper up to the level that defines
what it calls.

## A force-push that moves content obliges a description refresh

Force-with-lease protects the ref. It protects nobody's understanding of what the
branch now holds. When a rewrite moves content between levels of a stack, or
otherwise changes what a branch contains, refresh that pull request's description
before you ask anyone to read or merge it.

## Never commit working documents or images

**Keep these files out of the repository:**

| Pattern | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `docs/plans/*.md` | Working documents for planning, not repo content |
| `*.plan.md` | Temporary planning files |
| `SESSION_STATE.md` | Local session state |
| `*.png *.jpg *.jpeg *.gif *.webp *.avif *.svg *.ico` | Images go to external storage, not GitHub |

An image a PR needs as visual evidence is not an exception to that row. Upload it to the repository's durable `artifacts` release with `python3 ~/.claude/scripts/gh_artifact_upload.py <file> <owner/repo>` and embed the permanent URL in the PR comment. The image lives on GitHub without entering the repository tree.

## Responding to review feedback

**When this applies:** GitHub PR review feedback on a branch you are fixing.

1. Fetch every reviewer comment before making any fix.
2. Create a checklist in the session's task tool with one item per comment.
3. Fix systematically, marking each todo complete.
4. Reply to each comment inline.

Repair only the reported findings.

Every `gh` post in this workflow uses `--body-file` per `gh-cli-conventions.md` and keeps volatile scratch paths out per `durable-post-artifacts.md`. Stage session edits per `re-stage-before-commit.md` before each commit.
