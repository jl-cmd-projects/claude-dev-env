# Category J — CODE_RULES.md compliance

**What this category audits:** the hook-enforced and rubric-enforced rules from `~/.claude/docs/CODE_RULES.md`. Every PR passes through `code_rules_enforcer.py` at write time; flagging Category J findings during audit prevents fix-loops that the gate would otherwise trigger after the fact.

**Examples of Category J findings:**
- A literal `60` appears in a production function body (magic value rule).
- A new `MAX_RETRIES = 3` declared at module scope outside `config/`.
- A parameter named `ctx` where the name `context` belongs (abbreviation rule).
- A function that returns a value with no return-type annotation.
- A new `# explains the loop logic` comment added to production code.

**Companion reference:** see `../source-material-section-types.md`.

## Sub-bucket decomposition (Category J)

| ID | Axis name | Concrete checks |
|---|---|---|
| J1 | Magic values in production function bodies | Literals other than `0`, `1`, `-1` inside production function bodies. Test files exempt. |
| J2 | String-template magic | f-strings whose structural literal text (paths, URLs, patterns) belongs in `config/`. |
| J3 | Constants location | Module-level `UPPER_SNAKE = ...` outside `config/` in production code. Exempt path families: `config/*`, `/migrations/`, `/workflow/`, `_tab.py`, `/states.py`, `/modules.py`, test files. |
| J5 | Abbreviations | `ctx`, `cfg`, `msg`, `btn`, `idx`, `cnt`, `elem`, `val`, `tmp`, `str`, `num`, `arr`, `obj`, `fn`, `cb`, `req`, `res`. (Loop counters `i`/`j`/`k` and `e` for exceptions are exempt.) |
| J6 | Vague names | `result`, `data`, `output`, `response`, `value`, `item`, `temp`, `info`, `stuff`, `thing`. Vague prefixes: `handle`, `process`, `manage`, `do`. |
| J7 | Type hints | Missing type annotation on a parameter or return; presence of `Any` or `# type: ignore`. |
| J8 | New inline comments | New `#` or `//` comments in production or test code added by this diff; changed directive, TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, and type-ignore comments are also findings. |
| J9 | Logging format | `log_*(f"...")` where `log_*("...", arg)` belongs. |
| J10 | Imports inside functions | `import` statements placed inside function bodies. |
| J11 | sys.path.insert dedup | `sys.path.insert(0, X)` must be guarded by `if X not in sys.path:` (test files exempt). |
| J12 | Hardcoded user paths | String literals naming a specific user's home directory (`C:/Users/example/...`, `/Users/alice/...`, `/home/bob/...`). Use `pathlib.Path.home()`. |

The write-time hook (`code_rules_enforcer.py`) exempts test files (`test_*.py`, `*_test.py`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `conftest.py`, paths under `/tests/`) from most Category J sub-buckets, while comment changes use one rule for production and tests. It skips the naming, logging, annotation, and unused-import rules on `.mjs` / `.js` files. J11 (`sys.path.insert`) always applies. Read the next section for the sub-buckets this audit applies more widely than the hook.

When a change touches code that an existing comment describes or is attached to, remove that comment in the same change and carry its meaning through clear names and structure. Leave comments tied to untouched code unchanged. Keep comment cleanup inside the requested task. Production and tests follow one rule. Changed directive, TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, and type-ignore comments are removed. Do not add or justify them.

## Write-time exemptions do not scope this audit

The write-time hook skips several rules on test files and on `.mjs` / `.js` files. This audit does not. Apply these rules to every changed line — production files, test files, and JavaScript files alike:

- **Naming (J5, J6)** — banned identifiers (`ctx`, `cfg`, `msg`, `result`, `data`, `output`, `value`, `item`, `temp`, `elem`, `val`, …) and banned function prefixes (`handle_`, `process_`, `manage_`, `do_`); boolean names prefixed `is_` / `has_` / `should_` / `can_` / `was_` / `did_`.
- **Logging format (J9)** — the format string and its arguments pass as separate parameters (`log_*("...", arg)`), never an f-string.
- **Type annotations (J7)** — every changed function parameter and return is typed; no `Any`, no `# type: ignore` directives.
- **Unused imports** — a module-level import a changed file does not read is a finding.
- **Function length** — a changed function that runs past the length threshold splits into named helpers.

A `test_*.py` name or a `.mjs` extension takes the line out of the write-time gate only; this audit still covers it. When the diff touches a test or a JavaScript file, walk these five rules against the changed lines there too. J1 (magic values) and J3 (constants location) keep their test-file exemption.

## Sample prompt

The reusable Variant C template for Category J is in [`../prompts/category-j-code-rules-compliance.md`](../prompts/category-j-code-rules-compliance.md). Inline your artifact under `## Source material` and walk every sub-bucket — many J findings are caught by the write-time hook, but the audit catches the residue.
