# Install pstack across hosts

A full `claude-dev-env` install also installs [pstack](https://github.com/jl-cmd/pstack-claude) as a plugin from its own marketplace, so `npx -y claude-dev-env@latest` needs no second command. The plugin ships its own skills, agents, model defaults, and SessionStart hook. The `jl-cmd/pstack-claude` fork of the Claude and Codex port owns every one of those, so this repository holds no pstack tree, no pinned commit, and no adapter files. A nightly workflow in the fork runs the port's own sync tool against Cursor's upstream pstack and publishes each new upstream release.

## What the install step runs

For Claude Code, with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set to the managed root this run writes to:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add jl-cmd/pstack-claude
claude plugin install pstack@pstack-claude
```

For Codex, with `CODEX_HOME` set to the resolved Codex home:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add jl-cmd/pstack-claude
codex plugin add pstack@pstack-claude
```

After a successful Codex plugin install, a fresh Codex home receives the packaged pstack model mapping in `pstack-models.md` and its model guidance in `AGENTS.md`. The sheet sets the selected Astra, Sol, and Luna roles, reasoning effort, substitutions, and `session hook: on`. Codex reads the role guidance from `AGENTS.md`, while the plugin reads the hook setting from the sheet. If either file already exists, the installer leaves both files alone. Claude Code configuration stays under its own user control.

Both commands run without a prompt and report their outcome on stdout. Claude Code records the marketplace under `extraKnownMarketplaces` and the plugin under `enabledPlugins` in that root's `settings.json`, then unpacks the plugin under `plugins/cache/pstack-claude/pstack/<version>`.

## When a host is absent

Each host is one member of the batch. A host whose command-line tool is not on `PATH` is skipped, and a host whose command fails is reported. Either outcome leaves the other host installed and never stops the rules, hooks, and skills this run already wrote.

Set `CDE_CLAUDE_EXECUTABLE` or `CDE_CODEX_EXECUTABLE` to name an interpreter outside `PATH`.

## Turning the step off

The step runs on a full install only. A `--only <group>` run installs the named groups and skips it. Two controls turn it off:

- `npx -y claude-dev-env@latest --no-pstack`
- `CDE_INSTALL_PSTACK=0` in the environment

The plugin keeps its own state under each host's plugin store. The install manifest does not record those paths, so the stale-file prune and `--uninstall` leave the plugin in place. Remove it with `claude plugin uninstall pstack@pstack-claude` or `codex plugin remove pstack@pstack-claude`.

## Updating and configuring

Each install is a clean install. On each host it first uninstalls `pstack@pstack-claude` and removes the `pstack-claude` marketplace, then adds the marketplace again and installs the newest version it publishes. On Claude Code it then deletes every cached pstack version the CLI marked with `.orphaned_at`, so `plugins/cache/pstack-claude/pstack/` holds only the installed version. Codex deletes the old version's cache itself on `codex plugin remove`. A removal that finds nothing installed exits non-zero, and the install goes on.

Run `/pstack:setup-pstack` in Claude Code, or `setup-pstack` in Codex, to change the plugin's model defaults or turn its automatic routing off. This repository's own `subagent-model-policy.json` and its `subagent_model_routing` hook stay in place and are unrelated to the plugin's routing. A later install preserves existing Codex model files.

## Windows command shims

The pstack package provides `watch-pr` and `ship-pr` as extensionless Bun entrypoints. Windows cannot resolve those files as commands and opens the app picker when a playbook runs one by name.

`claude-dev-env` does not modify the pstack package. It installs optional user-owned shims at `~/.claude/scripts/windows/pstack/`. Copy the three files to a directory on `PATH`, such as `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin`:

```powershell
$source = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.claude\scripts\windows\pstack'
$target = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE '.local\bin'
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $target | Out-Null
Copy-Item -LiteralPath @(
    (Join-Path $source 'pstack-command-shim.ps1'),
    (Join-Path $source 'watch-pr.cmd'),
    (Join-Path $source 'ship-pr.cmd')
) -Destination $target -Force
```

The shim selects the newest installed pstack version under `$CODEX_HOME`, or under `%USERPROFILE%\.codex` when `CODEX_HOME` is unset. It runs Bun from pstack's scripts directory so package resolution works from any current directory. It passes command arguments and the exit code through unchanged.

Before launching the entrypoint, it runs pstack's dependency bootstrap in a separate Bun process. This makes the first invocation work when the installed plugin has not populated `node_modules` yet.

Open a new PowerShell window, then run:

```powershell
Get-Command watch-pr
watch-pr --help
ship-pr inspect --help
```

If the target directory is not on `PATH`, add it to the user `PATH` before running the checks.

## Retired integration points

An earlier `claude-dev-env` installed pstack itself: a pinned upstream commit, a release store under the managed root, generated host adapters, a `cde-pstack` command, a copied model selector, seeded model preference files, and a `session-continuity` companion registered as a hook in Claude, Codex, and Cursor. The plugin covers each of those, including the SessionStart context the companion supplied.

Every full install now clears the companion's hook registrations from all three host configuration files, because a registration left behind points every session at a deleted script.

## Cloud setup

For Claude cloud, `npx -y claude-dev-env@latest` in the environment setup script installs the plugin with everything else. For Codex cloud, put the two `codex plugin` commands above in the environment setup script.

Git and Node 22 or later are installer prerequisites. The plugin's own workflows still need the CLIs, browser access, credentials, and permissions their steps use.
