# Merge policy

This document states how a change reaches `main` in this repository. It names
the gates in the order they run, says which ones hold the merge and which ones
report only, says who performs the merge, and states the rollback path.

## The gates, in order

| Order | Gate | Holds the merge | Where it runs |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The pull request opens ready for review with a Before and an After in its body | yes | the agent that opens it |
| 2 | The full Python and JavaScript suites run on the pull request | yes | GitHub Actions |
| 3 | The install playtest installs the package into a scratch home and reads the envelopes a session-start hook and a blocking hook return | yes | GitHub Actions |
| 4 | The required status check reports green on the head commit | yes | GitHub Actions |
| 5 | The head is up to date with `main`, because the branch rule is strict | yes | GitHub Actions |
| 6 | Every review thread on the head is answered or resolved by the driving agent | yes | the driving agent |
| 7 | The `Review closure` check reports green on the head commit | yes | GitHub Actions |
| 8 | The merge check reads the live pull request and reports `MERGE` | yes | the driving agent |
| 9 | Advisory findings the follow-up ledger holds | no | the policy lint |
| 10 | Review-bot findings the reviewing bot marks optional | no | the review bots |

Gate 7 goes red while a blocking review finding on the head has no reply and no
resolving push, so a finding holds the merge until the driving agent answers it.
The check runs from the revision `.github/workflows/review-closure.yml` pins.

Gate 8 reads the pull request's live state: out of draft, merge state clean,
and no open review thread. It prints `HOLD` with the repair when one of those
fails, and every repair belongs to the driving agent.

Gates 9 and 10 report and record. A finding there opens its own pull request and
never holds this one.

The [install playtest guide](install-playtest.md) describes its stages and the red-run proof.

## The required status checks

The branch ruleset on `main` requires this context:

```required-status-checks
instruction-pairs / instruction-pairs
```

The branch rule asks for zero approvals and keeps heads up to date, so no human
approval is needed to merge here.

`packages/claude-dev-env/scripts/merge_gate_checks.py` reads the block above
and the branch ruleset, and reports every context named here that the ruleset
stopped requiring.
`packages/claude-dev-env/scripts/test_merge_gate_checks.py` runs that
comparison against the checked-in ruleset snapshot at
[`merge-policy-ruleset.json`](merge-policy-ruleset.json). Refresh the snapshot
with:

```
python packages/claude-dev-env/scripts/merge_gate_checks.py \
  --document docs/merge-policy.md \
  --ruleset docs/merge-policy-ruleset.json \
  --repository jl-cmd/claude-dev-env \
  --refresh
```

## Who merges

The agent that drives the pull request merges it, once the gates above pass.
This repository runs no merge queue, so the merge is a direct call on the pull
request.

No agent overrides a red check. A person merges by hand only when the owner says
to merge. Writes to production systems, to production databases, and to the
owner's machine outside a self-hosted runner job stay behind the owner's word.

## Rollback

A merge that has to come out goes back through the same path. The merge handler
thread opens a revert pull request, drives it through the gates above, and
merges it. Nobody pushes to `main` and nobody force-pushes it.
