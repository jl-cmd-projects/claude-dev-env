# Copilot instructions

Hooks in this repo enforce the conventions below. Follow them so your suggestions match what the gates accept.

**Canonical review contract:** `packages/claude-dev-env/docs/CODE_RULES.md`.
**Checked-in pointer:** `.cursor/BUGBOT.md`.

## Naming

- Full words, no abbreviations. Never name anything `ctx`, `cfg`, `msg`, `btn`, `idx`, `cnt`, `tmp`, `elem`, or `val` — write `context`, `configuration`, `message`, `button`, `index`, `count`, `element`, and so on.
- Never use the vague names `result`, `data`, `output`, `response`, `value`, `item`, or `temp`. Pick a domain noun that says what the thing is.
- Never start a function name with `handle_`, `process_`, `manage_`, or `do_`. Name the action: `validate_order`, `send_invite`, `build_prompt`.
- Boolean names start with `is_`, `has_`, `should_`, `can_`, `was_`, or `did_` (camelCase `is` / `has` / `should` / `can` / `was` / `did` in JavaScript and TypeScript).
- Loop variables read as `each_<noun>`. The single letters `i`, `j`, `k` are fine for numeric loops and `e` for a caught exception.

## Comments and documentation

- Do not add code comments. Preserve existing comments. Docstrings remain allowed.
- When a change touches code that an existing comment describes or is attached to, remove that comment in the same change and carry its meaning through clear names and structure. Leave comments tied to untouched code unchanged. Keep comment cleanup inside the requested task.
- Production and tests follow one rule. Changed directive, TODO, FIXME, HACK, XXX, and type-ignore comments are removed. Do not add or justify them.
- Docstrings on modules, classes, and functions are welcome. Keep the prose in step with the code: a docstring that lists the cases the body handles lists every one of them.
- Never drop an existing comment on a line you are not otherwise changing.
- Documentation describes the current state of the code. State what the code is and does, not how it got there.

## Types

- Every function parameter and every return is typed.
- Do not use `Any`, do not use `cast()`, or add `# type: ignore`; remove the escape hatch and use a typed boundary or real type.

## Constants and configuration

- No magic values in a production function body. The numbers `0`, `1`, and `-1` are fine.
- Constants live in `config/` or a `*_constants` package, never as a loose `UPPER_SNAKE` at module scope in a production file.
- Search for an existing constant before adding a new one, and reuse it.

## Logging

- Pass the format string and its arguments as separate parameters: `log_info("saved %d rows for %s", row_count, account_id)`. Never pass an f-string to a `log_*` call.

## Imports

- Every import sits at the top of the module, never inside a function body.
- Drop an import the file does not read.

## Structure

- Prefer functions over classes when there is no state to hold. Prefer a concrete class over an abstract base until a second implementation exists.
- Keep functions small and single-purpose. Use guard clauses and early returns to keep nesting shallow.
